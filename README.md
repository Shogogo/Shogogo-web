**ShoGoGo**
=====================

**Shogogo.com** notifies users when their favorite bands are playing nearby. Users simply search
for their favorite bands and provide a valid phone number. Every night, Shogogo queries the
SeatGeek API for new events. If a match is found, the user is sent a scheduled text message
with a link to buy tickets.
